        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <pre>
            <ul>
              <li>For Koftas, first boil potatoes and then mix grated potatoes, grated paneer, chopped green chilli and ginger, chopped cashews, chopped coriander leaves, corn flour and salt in a bowl. Divide it in equal portions and make koftas of it in any shape.</li>
              <li>Heat sufficient oil in a kadhai and deep fry the koftas on medium flame till slightly coloured. Drain on absorbent paper.</li>           
               <li>For the gravy, heat oil along with butter in a kadhai. Add cinnamon, black and green cardamom, bay leaf, cumin seeds, dry red chilli into it. Saute it and then add chopped onions into it.</li>
               <li>As the onions start browning, add chopped ginger-garlic into it, saute it for a minute and then add all the dry masalas and salt into it. Cook it well and then add tomatoes and cashews into it.</li>
               <li>Add 1/2 cup of water and cook it well for 3-4 minutes on low flame. As the tomatoes become little mussy, then switch off the flame and cool it. Take out the bay leaf and then grind it well and sieve it.</li>
               <li>Take a pan, add the grinded masalas, kasoori methi, 1-2 cup of water to it ( as the consistency of gravy required) and give it a boil and then add fresh cream into it, mix it and switch off the flame.  </li>
               <li>Place warm koftas in a serving dish and pour the hot gravy on top. Garnish it with some coriander leaves and fresh cream and serve it.</li>
