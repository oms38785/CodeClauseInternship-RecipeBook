              <li>   Once sauteed well, add chilly powder, coriander powder, garam masala,fennel powder and saute. Add oil as needed to fry the masalas. ** This is a bit spicy curry. So adjust chilly powder according to your spice tolerance level.
              <li>   Grind the tomatoes. Once masalas are done, add tomato into it.
              <li>   Saute for around 5 minutes in medium flame, until tomatoes are cooked.
              <li>    Saute for around 5 minutes in medium flame, until tomatoes are cooked.
              <li>    Add water. Bring it to boil and adjust salt in the gravy. Then add marinated chicken pieces. Stir till the chicken pieces are well coated.
